  <p> UniView is an HTML-based application for working with Unicode characters. You can look up  or find characters (using graphics or fonts) and related information, view whole character blocks or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, paste in and discover unknown characters, search for characters using regular expressions, do hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. It supports Unicode 9.0 and is
    written with Web Standards to work on a variety of browsers.</p>

  <h2><a href="#overview">Quick start</a></h2>
  <p>To get started, use the <span class="onscreen">Show block</span> selector, or add characters or code points to one of the fields on the <span class="onscreen">Look up</span> tab and hit the
    <input src="images/apply.gif" alt="down-arrow"  type="image" style="border:0; margin:0; padding:0;  vertical-align: top;" />
    icon.
    UniView produces <strong>tables</strong> or <strong>lists</strong> of characters in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span> (lower left).</p>
          <p>By default, clicking on a character in a list or table displays <strong>detailed information</strong> for that character in the <span class="onscreen">Character detail panel</span> (to the right).</p>
  <p> Use the <img src="images/clicktocparea.png" alt=" " style="height: 2em; width: 2em;" /> toggle switch to add the characters to the <span class="onscreen">Text area</span>  instead.  Alternatively, you can paste characters  directly into the <span class="onscreen">Text area</span>  and hit
    <input src="images/apply.gif" alt="the down-arrow icon"  type="image" style="border:0; margin:0; padding:0;  vertical-align: top;" />
    to discover what they are.</p>

  <h2><a href="#controlsexplained">Lookup controls</a></h2>
   
   <section id="show_block">
    <h3><a href="#show_block">Look up &gt; Show block</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/show_block.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>Select a Unicode block from the pull-down list and the characters in the block will be displayed below. You can then click on characters to view detailed information about them or add them to the text area, etc.</p>
    <p>Click on the <img src="images/help/down_arrow.png" alt=""> icon to refresh the results.</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can display the result as either a table or a list (that includes names) by clicking the check box lower down entitled <span class="onscreen">Show range as list</span>.</li>
      <li>Unassigned character positions are shown in the table with a greyed out background.</li>
      <li>You can also specify a Unicode range by typing or pasting a hex code point range into the <span class="onscreen">Show range</span> box below this control.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="show_range">
    <h3><a href="#show_range">Look up &gt; Show range</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/show_range.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If you type or paste a start and end code point value (in hex) into this control, the characters in the range will display below. Note that this can only be one contiguous range.</p>
    <p>Click on the <img src="images/help/down_arrow.png" alt=""> icon to refresh the results.</p>
    <p>If the range you select does not fill a whole column when displayed as a table, surrounding characters are greyed out. (When displaying as a list, you will only see the characters in the range.)</p>
    <p>The <span class="onscreen">Show range</span> field will accept various formats, making it easier to paste a range from elsewhere. The numbers must be in hexadecimal form but can be separated by either a colon (the default), a hyphen, one or more spaces, or one or more periods. The code point values themselves can be in the following formats: 1234, &amp;#x1234;, \1234;, \u1234, U+1234. The actual number of hex digits can be between 1 and 6.</p>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can display the result as either a table or a list (that includes names) by clicking the check box lower down entitled <span class="onscreen">Show range as list</span>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
          <section id="find_control">
    <h3><a href="#find_control">Look up &gt; Find</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/find_control.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>This control accepts a list of codepoint values in hexadecimal or decimal, a list of characters or a search string. After adding content to the input box, click on the appropriate button below the control to activate lookup. (If the right button was already highlighted, you could just hit Enter or click on <img border="0" src="images/apply.gif" align="bottom" alt="the down-arrow icon" />. </p>
    <p>Click on <img src="images/clearpicker.png" alt="the X icon" /> to quickly clear the control.</p>
    <h4>Looking for hex or dec codepoints</h4>
    
    <p>By default the control expects hex codepoint values. To look up a decimal value, click on the <span class="onscreen">Dec</span> button.</p>
    <p>This field is very forgiving about the format of the text entered into the box. Most types of  character escapes will be recognised, and you can even paste in surrounding text. For example, UniView will detect and list the characters referred to by code point in the text &quot;<em>the decomposition mapping is &lt;U+CE20, U+11B8&gt;, and not &lt;U+110E, U+1173, U+11B8&gt;.</em>&quot; Of course, this is not foolproof, but should provide the desired results most of the time.</p>
    <h4>Looking for characters</h4>
    <p>If the <span class="onscreen">Characters</span> button is selected, each character in the control will be processed. (Much of the time you will probably find it easier to use the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>  for this, but this control can be used if you want to look up some characters without disturbing a set of characters you are building up or using in the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>.)</p>
    <h4>Using search</h4>
    <p>By selecting the <span class="onscreen">Search</span> button you can search for text in the Unicode database, and returns a list of matching characters.</p>
    <p>You can  use  regular expressions in searches. For example, suppose you wanted to
              find all characters with the word 'tet'. You could type into the input field, <code>\btet\b</code>. The \b represents a word boundary. If you wanted to search for entries containing either the word 'tet' or the word 'tat' you can use the 'or' operator <code>|</code> as in <code>\btet\b|\btat\b</code>. (In UniView a colon can be used as a short form of <code>\b</code> so the example could have been written <code>:tet:</code>).</p>
    <p>Another example: You want to search for 'alpha', but you only want results for the Latin characters (not the many Greek or
              mathematical results). Simply use the following search string <code>latin.*alpha</code>. The <code>.*</code> represents any number of intervening
              characters.</p>
    <p>Basic regular expressions that work in  JavaScript  code should work. </p>
    <p>By default searches match against  character names and alternative names in the main Unicode database, and also searches the information displayed for an individual character under the heading Description in the right panel. You can limit the search using the <span class="onscreen">Names</span>, <span class="onscreen">Descriptions</span> and <span class="onscreen">Other</span> check boxes that appear above the  input box. <span class="onscreen">Other</span> refers to alternative names. If you want to set these before searching, just click on the <span class="onscreen">Search</span> button with nothing in the input box. It will bring up the checkboxes, which you can set as required. Then just enter your search string and click again on the <span class="onscreen">Search</span> button.</p>
    <p>You can also limit the search to the  characters  currently in a list or table.  To limit the search, select the check box labelled <span class="onscreen">Local</span>.  Matching characters will be highlighted. (You can then produce a list of just the highlighted characters by clicking on the icon next to <span class="onscreen">Filter </span><span class="onscreen">&gt; Make list from highlights</span>. If you need to refine your search, you could then search again on this list, and so on.)</p>
    <p>To clear the highlighting after doing a local search, just clear the <span class="onscreen">Find</span> input box, and hit the <span class="onscreen">Search</span> button again.</p>

  <section id="use_graphics">
    <h3><a href="#use_graphics">Look up &gt; Use graphics</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/use_graphics.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If the check box is selected,  characters (apart from those in the <span class="onscreen">text area</span>  and notes area) will be shown as images, rather than text. </p>
    <p>Dedicated images are available for all characters except for those in the large Han, Hangul and Tangut blocks. Many of those characters are 
              however also available thanks to an agreement with the folks who run the <a href="http://decodeunicode.org/">decodeunicode</a> server.</p>
    <p>If you  want to find fonts, check out the <a href="/scripts/links">script resource pages</a>. When you select a Unicode block, a pointer to the relevant page appears at the top right of the panel. </p>

  <section id="show_list">
    <h3><a href="#show_list">Look up &gt; Show range as list</a></h3>
    <p><img src="images/help/show_list.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>If the check box is selected when you select a range using <span class="onscreen">Show block </span>or <span class="onscreen">Show range</span> the characters will be displayed as a list, rather than a table.</p>
    <p>You can also use this to switch between table and list views of a range you have just selected.</p>

    <p>If you display information about a character in the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span> (lower right) and  there are notes available for that character they will be displayed at the bottom of the page if this control is selected.</p>
    <p>The notes are not authoritative. They are compiled by myself as I learn about various scripts and characters. They are made available in case they are of use, but you should not assume that they are always correct, and they are certainly not complete.</p>

<section id="text_area">
  <h2><a href="#text_area">Text area</a></h2>
          <p>The <span class="onscreen">Text area</span>  is associated with a set of controls for managing characters as text. It makes UniView like a character map or picker tool, but also much more.ou can add characters to the text area from other parts of UniView, or you can simply paste text into it for analysis.</p>
          <p>The insertion point for characters echoed to  the text area  can be changed in most browsers by just clicking where you want characters to appear, but not Internet Explorer, where characters are always added to the end of the line. If you highlight a range of text, any typed or echoed characters will replace the highlighted range.</p>
    <p id="text_area_controls"><strong class="leadin">Text area controls.</strong> You can interact with the text in the text area using the icons below it. They are described here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p id="destination_toggle"><img src="images/clicktocparea.png" alt="with the two arrows" style="height: 2em; width: 2em;" /> Click on this to toggle between greyed-out or not. While the icon is not greyed out,  clicking on characters in a list or table in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span>  will  add them to the text area at the  cursor position. When greyed out, character details will appear in the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span>, instead. </p>
              <p>To help make it more obvious when characters will be routed to the text area, the left edge of the latter will change colour. (You can also click on this to switch the target location.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/apply.gif" alt="down-arrow" width="23" height="25" border="0" align="bottom" /> Creates  a list in the <span ><span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span></span> of the characters in the text area. This is particularly useful for investigating text with characters you can't see or correctly identify. Simply paste the text into the text area and click on this icon, and UniView will produce a list of the names and code points for all the characters in the text area.            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/selectall.png" align="bottom" alt="with two facing square brackets" /> Highlights all the text in the box. (Particularly useful to check you have caught all combining characters when copy-pasting to another location.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/tochar.png" align="bottom" alt="upwards pointing arrow" />  Copies to the text area  all the characters currently displayed in a list or table in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span>. This is particularly useful for capturing search results, or making a list of all characters in a block, etc.</p>
              <p>If you have filtered out characters in the <span class="onscreen">Character list panel</span>, only the unfiltered characters will be added to the text area.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/addspace.png" align="bottom" alt="with a low line" /> Adds spaces between each of the characters in the text area. This is useful for generating space-separated lists of characters, or sometimes just for making it easier to see what characters are in the text area.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/addspace.png" align="bottom" alt="with a low line" />  Adds commas between each of the characters in the text area. This is useful for generating comma-separated lists of characters to be copy-pasted elsewhere.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/expand.png" alt="the hyphen icon" /> Any hyphen-separated lists in the text area are expanded. For example, if you have <samp>A-Z</samp> in the text box, it will be replaced with <samp>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</samp>.  You can expand multiple ranges at the same time. For example, <samp>A-Za-z0-9</samp> will expand to include all intervening characters for the three ranges specified.            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/count.png" alt="the hash icon" /> Counts the number of codepoints in the text area.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/han.gif" alt="the icon that looks like a Japanese character" /> Look up han characters in the text area in the UniHan database.  (Opens a page in a separate window.)</p>
    <p>If you have more than one code point or character in the box, UniView will open a separate window containing Unihan information for each. If you try to open more than 5 windows, a warning will pop up.</p>
    <p>You can also find a link to the Unihan database in the <span class="onscreen">character details panel</span>  when a CJK Unified Ideograph is displayed there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/convert.png" alt="the icon with overlapping boxes" /> Converts characters in the text area to various escape or other forms. (Opens a page in a separate window.)</p>
              <p>(You can also look up a single character at a time from the <span class="onscreen">character details panel</span> by clicking on the <span class="onscreen">Conversion tool</span> link.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/case-simple.png" alt="Analyse" /> Displays the characters in the text area  in a list in the lower right part of the page with all relevant characters converted to uppercase, lowercase and titlecase. Characters that had no case conversion information are also listed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/case-detail.png" alt="Analyse" /> Produces the same kind of output as clicking on the icon just above, but shows the mappings for those characters that have been changed, eg. <samp>eâ†’E</samp>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img border="0" src="images/nfc.png" align="bottom" alt="Ã§" /> or <img border="0" src="images/nfd.png" align="bottom" alt="the NFD icon" /> Converts the text in the text area to Unicode Normalization Form C or D (NFC or NFD). The change may not be obvious, but if you click on <img border="0" src="images/apply.gif" align="bottom" alt="the down-arrow icon" /> you should see any changes to the text.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><img src="images/clearpicker.png" alt="X" /> Clears all text from the text area.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

<section>
<h2 id="char_list_panel"><a href="#char_list_panel">Character list panel</a></h2>

<img  style="float: left; margin: 0 2em 2em 7.5%" src="images/help/list_panel.png" alt=""/>
<p>The character list panel is where you will see tables and lists of characters that you generate from elsewhere in UniView.</p>
<p>When characters are displayed in table format and you hover over a character in this area you will see the code point and name appear at the top of the panel.</p>
<p>Whether in table or list format, if you click on a character one of two things will happen. Either details for that character will appear to the right, or the character will be added to the text area. The former is the default, but the latter will happen if you have indicated that it should by clicking on the <a href="#destination_toggle">icon described above</a>.</p>
<p>Unassigned character positions in a table are shown with a greyed out background (though you can <a href="#tailor">change</a> the colour, if you want).</p>
</section>



<section style="clear:both;">
<h2 id="tags"><a href="#notes_panel">Tags</a></h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/help/tags.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>A basic set of links is shown for each block or range of characters to allow you to quickly highlight characters with the property <code class="kw" translate="no">letter</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">mark</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">number</code>, <code class="kw" translate="no">punctuation</code>, or <code class="kw" translate="no">symbol</code>. For more fine-grained property distinctions, see the <span class="onscreen">Filter</span> panel.</p>
<p>In addition, for some blocks there are other links available that reflect tags assigned to characters. <strong>This tagging is far from exhaustive!</strong> For instance,  clicking on <span class="onscreen">sanskrit</span> will not show all characters used in Sanskrit. </p>
<p>The tags are just intended to be an aid to help you find certain characters quickly by exposing words that appear in the character descriptions or block subsection titles. For example, if you want to find the Bengali currency symbol, click on <span class="onscreen">currency</span> and all other characters but those related to currency will be dimmed.</p>
<p>(Since the highlight function is used for this, don't forget that, if you happen to highlight a useful subset of characters and want to work with just those, you can use the <span class="onscreen">Make list from highlights</span> command, or click on the <img border="0" src="images/tochar.png" align="bottom" alt="upwards pointing arrow" /> icon to move those characters into the text area.)</p>
</section>



<section style="clear:both;">
<h2 id="char_detail_panel"><a href="#char_detail_panel">Character detail panel</a></h2>

<img style="float: right; margin: 0 32% 2em 2em" src="images/help/details_panel.png" alt=""/>
<p>This panel shows detailed information and links for a single character.</p>
<p>The previous and next clickable text at the top allows you to step through characters in the block one by one. It skips code values that don't have assignments, and at the end of a block it will move you to the first character of the following block, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Han and hangul characters you will see a link <span class="onscreen">View in PDF code charts (pageXX)</span>. For Han blocks, this will open the PDF file for the block. The PDF is useful if there is no picture or font glyph for that character, but also allows you to see the variant forms of the character. Get <a href="#canviewhan">more information</a>.</p>
</section>



<section style="clear:both;">
<h2 id="notes_panel"><a href="#notes_panel">Notes panel</a></h2>

<p>The notes panel appears only when a check mark appears alongside <span class="onscreen">Show notes</span> in the <span class="onscreen">Lookup panel</span>. It also only appears if notes actually exist for character being displayed in the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span>.</p>
<p>The notes provide information I have gathered while learning about scripts, and should not be considered authoritative. Notes may change and new notes will be added from time to time.</p>
<p>If a note is displayed, you'll also find a link at the bottom of the <span class="onscreen">Character details panel</span> that allows you to open the full page from which the notes were taken. These pages carry annotations for a whole Unicode block or set of blocks.</p>

    <ul>
              <li><strong>uniview/?char=&lt;hex-codepoint&gt;</strong> Displays the information about the specified character in the right panel on
        startup.<br/>
        Eg. <a

              <li><strong>uniview/?block=&lt;block-name&gt;</strong> Displays the specified block in the left panel on startup. The block name must
        be written exactly as it appears in the pulldown selector at the top left of the page, except that any spaces must be replaced by either underscores
        ('_') or '%20', and case is not important. (Tip: when typing the this in a browser's address bar you can just use spaces.) <br/>
        Eg. <a
						href="/uniview/?block=latin%20extended-b">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?block=latin%20extended-b</a></li>
              <li><strong>uniview/?codepoints=&lt;list-of-hex-codepoints&gt;</strong> A list of the characters will be displayed in the left panel. Any spaces must be replaced by
        either underscores ('_') or '%20', and case is not important.<br/>
        Eg. <a
						href="/uniview/?codepoints=449%201234%2065">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?codepoints=449%201234%2065</a></li>

  </section>
          <!--<div class="topic"> 

				<h3 class="collapse">creating your own character description notes <span style="color:red;">[Updated]</span></h3>
				<p>These notes will appear immediately below the standard information in the right panel. To see how this works, type into the 'Notes'
					field the following:</p>
				<blockquote> 
					<p>notes/devanagari.xml</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p> Then select the devanagari block from the top left. Next click on characters such as U+0902: DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA. You will see
					the additional notes under a horizontal bar in the right panel.</p>
				<p>You can link to any appropriate notes file on the internet - your own or someone elses - by entering the URI in the 'Notes' field.
					</p>
				<p>Follow these steps to create your own notes.</p>
				<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create your own XHTML file containing the notes you want, character by character. The notes for each
					individual character should be surrounded by a &lt;div&gt; element which has an id attribute set to C&lt;hexcode&gt; and a class name set to 'notes'.
					For example, notes for the U+0902: DEVANAGARI SIGN ANUSVARA would be placed inside the following markup: &lt;div id="C0902"
					class="notes"&gt;....&lt;/div&gt;. Everything inside this div will be displayed when you view that character in the right-hand panel.</p>
				<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a copy of your file with the extension '.xml' and upload the file to an accessible place. (You could
					just serve that file as XML, but making a copy allows you to access the original as HTML still.)</p>
				<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Type the URI of your file into the 'Notes' field.</p>
				<p>Now whenever you display a character for which notes exist in the right-hand panel, your notes will appear also. </p>
				<p>Apart from things like IPA characters (which are spread across several blocks), I tend to use separate files for separate scripts, but
					you can decide whether your file contains notes on characters from a single block or many blocks. It doesn't matter. </p>

   <p>Changes to the database and representative shapes made during the beta phase have now been integrated into UniView.</p>
   <p>In addition, a quick filter facility was added just below the character list panel. This allows you to filter the characters according to some basic properties, and in some cases there are additional tags available, based on the words in the the character descriptions or block subsection titles. Such additional tagging is far from exhaustive or perfect, they are just intended to provide some additional help for finding certain characters.</p>
   <p>(Since the highlight function is used for this, don't forget that, if you happen to highlight a useful subset of characters and want to work with just those, you can use the <span class="onscreen">Make list from highlights</span> command, or click on the <img border="0" src="images/tochar.png" align="bottom" alt="upwards pointing arrow" /> icon  to move those characters into the text area.) </p>

<section id="v900beta">
  <h3><a href="#v900beta">Changes in version 9.0.0beta</a></h3>
   <p>UniView now supports the characters introduced for the beta version of Unicode 9. Any changes made during the beta period will be added when Unicode 9 is officially released. (Images are not available for the Tangut additions, but the character information is available.)</p>
   <p>It also brings in notes for individual characters where those notes exist, if <span class="onscreen">Show notes</span> is selected. These notes are not authoritative, but are provided in case they prove useful.</p>
   <p>A new icon was added below the text area to add commas between each character in the text area.</p>
   <p>Links to the help page that used to appear on mousing over a control have been removed. Instead there is a noticeable, blue link to the help page, and the help page has been reorganised and made easier to find information using image maps.  The reorganisation puts more emphasis on learning by exploration, rather than learning by reading.</p>
   <p>Various tweaks were made to the user interface.</p>

  <section id="v700">
    <h3><a href="#v700">Changes in version 7.0.0</a></h3>
    <p>This version updates the app per the changes during  beta phase of the specification, so that it now reflects the finalised Unicode 7.0.0.</p>
    <p>The initial in-app help information displayed for new users was significantly updated, and the help tab now links directly to the help page.</p>
    <p>A more significant improvement was the addition of links to character descriptions (on the right) where such details exist. This finally reintegrates the information that was previously pulled in from a database.  Links are only provided where additional data actually exists. </p>
    <p>Rather than pull the data into the page, the link opens a new window containing the appropriate information. This has advantages for comparing data, but it was also the best solution I could find without using PHP (which is no longer available on the server I use). It also makes it easier to edit the character notes, so the amount of such detail should grow faster. In fact, some additional pages of notes were added along with this upgrade.</p>
    <p>A pop-up window containing resource information used to appear when you used the query to show a block. This no longer happens.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="v7beta">
    <h3><a href="#v7beta">Changes in version 7beta</a></h3>
    <p>This version adds the 2,834 new characters  encoded in the Unicode 7.0.0 beta, including characters for 23 new scripts. It also simplified the user interface, and eliminated most of the bugs introduced in the quick port to JavaScript that was the previous version.</p>
    <p>Some features that were available in version 6.1.0a are still not available, but they are minor.</p>
    <p>Significant changes to the UI include the removal of the 'popout' box, and the merging of the search input box with that of the other features listed under <span class="onscreen">Find</span>. </p>
    <p>In addition, the buttons that used to appear when you select a Unicode block have changed. Now the block name appears near the top right of the page with a <img src="images/info.gif" alt="I icon"/> icon. Clicking on the icon takes you to a page listing resources for that block, rather than listing the resources in the lower right part of UniView's interface.</p>
    <p>UniView no longer uses a database to display additional notes about characters. Instead, the information is being added to HTML files. When one of these files contains information for a particular block, you'll see a link to it from the detailed information for a particular character. At some future point, I may pull the information for that character into UniView, as before, but for the time being clicking on the <span class="onscreen">Character notes</span> link opens the page in a separate window. Initially such a link is only available for Tibetan, but I will add more from time to time.</p>
